Run preprocessing as described in ../data_preparation/kth/README


for N in range(1, 25):

    Run training for the fold in which videos of subject N are used as test set: 
    python train_attention_rnn_on_kth.py --test-person N

    Run computation of avg. test IoU for corresponding test set:
    python eval_test_IoU.py --test-person 1

Compute the average test IoU over subjects:
python compute_avg_leave_one_out_crossvalid_IoU.py
